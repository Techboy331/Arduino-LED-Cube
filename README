### ARDUINO LED CUBE
	created by Chris P.

Hello World! This is the Github page for my Arduino LED cube project! I have worked hard on this, and it is finally coming together! 

On this site I will include some of my notes from the development process, as well as pictures and videos for visual aid. Please check out the schematic and whatnot if you are interested. I am new to open source, but I think I will release my code under the creative commons license, but I have to research it first.
