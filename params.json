Its circuitry allows for LEDs to be individually addressed in the programming. \r\n\r\nI have made an HTML/PHP program that utilizes checkboxes to write Arduino compatible code to light up LEDs. This program saves time, and is also pretty neat!\r\n\r\nI have also added a Joystick and two pushbuttons as input devices that can be used in any way. I personally am attempting to make Snake in 3D with the Joystick, but I hope to eventually publish this project as an open source kit.\r\n\r\n\r\n###Bill of Materials\r\n***\r\n+ 3 packs of 25 diffused blue 3mm LEDs (75 LEDS, only 64 are used): https://www.adafruit.com/products/780\r\n+ 25 150 Ohm Resistors, for current limiting the LEDs\r\n+ 7 10k Ohm Resistors, to pull up the buttons and pull down the transistors\r\n+ 2 pushbuttons\r\n+ 2 2D Thumb Joysticks (1 used): https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9032?\r\n+ 1 Rocker On/Off Switch, wired in line with the power supply\r\n+ Arduino Mega\r\n+ 9v Power Supply AC: https://www.adafruit.com/products/63\r\n+ Really Big Protoboard: http://www.jameco.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/Product_10001_10001_206594_-1?CID=PDF\r\n+ USB A to B cable\r\n\r\n\r\n###System Operation Scheme\r\n***\r\n1. The Arduino applies power to a programmed number of anode columns (my pins are 23-38)\r\n2. The Transistors grant ground to only one layer at a time\r\n\r\n- The use of 4x4x4 3D arrays allows the Arduino to light up different LEDs in different layers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","name":"Arduino-led-cube"}
