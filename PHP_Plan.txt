Plan for PHP program in 

Pseudo code

1. Check each checkbox matrix value to see if the box was checked
I'm assuming "checked" is a boolean value...

2. somehow use the value of the checkbox to script that if it was clicked, it should an index in the 3d
array to be that value: 

It seems that I will need to have a 2d array for each matrix of checkboxes...

X && Y are any number 0-3

if Checkbox at position [X][Y] is clicked in Layer 1, set animate[layer#-1][X][X]=to the corresponding pin number




3. Print the 3D array

$3darray[4][4][4]={0};
